                            <li>Like many companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies on the Website
                                (jointly,
                                “cookies” unless otherwise stated) including flash local storage and web beacons/GIFs as
                                defined below.</li>
                            <li>We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your user experience and
                                obtain
                                data about how the Website is being used. There may be some SDK integrated into the
                                Website
                                which may also collect your data. These data enable us to develop and optimize the
                                Website
                                and make our Services more relevant for you.</li>
                            <li>Software Development Kits (“SDK”) are programming packages or libraries of code of one
                                service incorporated in a code of another service so those applications could work on or
                                with a specific platform of an SDK owner. When your data is collected through SDK,
                                third-party SDK owners can access the data as described below. If we use SDK, we will
                                notify
                                you.</li>

                            <li>Cookies are small pieces of code that are stored on your device when you browse and use
                                online services. They are installed on your device to enable different useful features,
                                for example, to facilitate navigation on the Website. After installed on your device,
                                cookies may be either deleted automatically when you close the Website/web browser
                                (session cookies), or stored on your device to facilitate future visits to the Website
                                (persistent cookies). Permanent cookies are automatically deleted after a period of time
                                set by the cookies’ owner.</li>
                            <li>Flash Local storage allows data to be stored locally on your browser or device and
                                includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache.</li>
                            <li>Web beacon are small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as “1×1
                                GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in the Website’s pages and our messages. Web
                                beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code
                                inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with
                                a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are
                                stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages
                                and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</li>
                            <li>In some cases, cookies are used to collect data that is recognized to be personal data,
                                such as IP addresses and data linked to the IP address. The usage of such cookies is
                                regulated by the data protection laws, and you as a user obtain more rights to control
                                the collection and processing of this data.</li>
                            <li>Providing you with our services, we may use the following cookies: a) essential or
                                strictly necessary cookies; b) performance cookies; c) analytical cookies; d)
                                targeting/advertising cookies. These cookies may be session or persistent.</li>
                            <li>Session cookies are only stored temporarily in the browser’s memory, and are destroyed
                                when it is closed down, although they will survive navigating away from the Website they
                                came from. Persistent cookies are saved on your computer so that when you close it down
                                and start it up again, it can still be there; they are created by giving them an expiry
                                date and when that expiry date is reached, they will be destroyed by the computer. If
                                the expiry date is not set then they are automatic</li>
                            <li>“Essential” or “Strictly Necessary" cookies are strongly required for the error-free
                                operation of the website, as well as for its security and accessibility and we also need
                                it to remember your choice about cookies. Without them we will not be able to provide
                                you with the Services in a proper way. Despite you cannot refuse these cookies through
                                the Website, you may decline them by changing your browser settings, but this may affect
                                the Website’s functioning. These cookies are mostly session and expire on closing the
                                browser.</li>
                            <li>“Performance” cookies collect information about how you use the Website, for instance
                                which pages you go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These
                                cookies don’t collect information that identifies you. All information these cookies
                                collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the
                                website works. Generally, these cookies are a mix of session and persistent cookies.
                            </li>
                            <li>“Analytical” cookies allow us to track your activity on the Website. We may track the
                                number of sessions, measure sessions durations, characteristics of their devices, pages
                                you visit, etc. We do so to optimize the Website and make it more interesting and useful
                                for you. The data collected in such a way is stored in aggregated form, and it does not
                                constitute personally identifiable information. Generally, these cookies are a mix of
                                session and persistent cookies.</li>
                            <li>“Targeting/Advertising” cookies allow us to show you our advertisements on third-party
                                websites. This tool is called “retargeting”. It enables us to provide you with ads based
                                on your previous activity on the website. It also enables us to limit how many times you
                                see the respective ads. Generally, these cookies are persistent cookies.</li>
                            <li>We may use the following cookies:</li>

                                across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest
                                cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the
                                cookie is removed.</td>
