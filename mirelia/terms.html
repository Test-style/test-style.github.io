                        <ol>
                            <li>MIRELIA is hereby authorized to use the trade names or trademarks of Advertisers for the
                                purposes of this Agreement without any further written approval from the party owning
                                such name or trademark.</li>
                            <li>Force Majeure. Except for payment obligations, if either party is prevented from
                                performing or is unable to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement due to
                                causes beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, including but
                                not limited to acts of God, acts of civil or military authorities, riots or civil
                                disobedience, wars, strikes or labor disputes (each, a “Force Majeure Event”), such
                                party’s performance shall be excused and the time for performance shall be extended
                                accordingly provided that the party immediately takes all reasonably necessary steps to
                                resume full performance. If such a party remains unable to continue full performance
                                fifteen (15) days after the Force Majeure Event, the other party may terminate this
                                Agreement upon written notice.</li>
                            <li>Severability. Should any of the provisions of this Agreement be adjudged invalid or
                                unenforceable by the rules and regulations of Cyprus or a Cyprus court, such provisions
                                shall be deemed several from the remainder of this Agreement and not affect the validity
                                or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement. In that case, such provisions
                                shall be changed and interpreted to achieve the purposes of those provisions as much as
                                possible within the extent of relevant laws or judgment of the court.</li>
                            <li>Survival. Sections 6, 7, 8, and 10 shall survive termination or expiration of this
                                Agreement for any reason. All other rights and obligations of the parties under this
                                Agreement shall expire upon termination of this Agreement, except that all payment
                                obligations accrued hereunder prior to termination or expiration shall survive such
                                termination.

                            <li>Assignment. MIRELIA is hereby authorized to assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise
                                transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
                                consent of the other party provided that the assignee shall assume all rights and
                                obligations under this Agreement. Advertiser shall not assign, sublicense, delegate or
                                otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations. However, Advertiser may, without
                                the consent of MIRELIA, assign this Agreement to an entity merging with, consolidating
                                with, or purchasing all its assets or stock substantially, provided that the assignee
                                shall assume in writing all rights and obligations under this Agreement.</li>
                            <li>Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
                                deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person (including by internationally
                                recognized commercial delivery service), and on the day the notice is sent when sent by
                                verified facsimile or email with confirmation receipt, if the time of transmission is
                                during recipient’s business day, or if not on the next business day thereafter, in each
                                case to the respective parties at the postal or email addresses provided by them in
                                writing. Either party may change its address by giving the other party with written
                                notice of the change in accordance with this section.</li>
                            <li>Relationship of Parties. The parties are independent contractors and will have no right
                                to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other party.
                                Neither party shall hold itself out as an agent of the other party. This Agreement will
                                not be construed to create or imply any partnership, agency, joint venture, or formal
                                business entity of any kind.</li>
                            <li>Waiver. No delay or failure by either party to exercise any right or remedy under this
                                Agreement will constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. All waivers must be in
                                writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party waiving its rights. A
                                waiver by any party of any breach or covenant shall not be construed as a waiver of any
                                succeeding breach of any other covenant.</li>
                            <li>Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
                                and supersedes all previous agreements, oral or written, with respect to the subject
                                matter of this Agreement. The information and documents provided by Advertiser(s) to
                                MIRELIA, as requested by the latest in order to enter the Agreement, shall also be
                                considered as part of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended without the
                                written consent of the parties.</li>
                            <li>Headings. The headings of the articles and paragraphs contained in this Agreement are
                                inserted for convenience and are not intended to be part of or to affect the

                            </li>
                            <li>Construction. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Agreement has been jointly
                                prepared, and its provisions will not be construed more strictly against either party as
                                a result of its participation in such preparation.</li>
                            <li>Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, or online, which taken
                                together shall form one legal instrument.</li>
                            <li>No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to
                                the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein,
                                express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any legal or
                                equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
                                Agreement.</li>
